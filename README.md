## Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The challenges I faced in this was first creating the date created conversion column and then extract years from it by using years() function.

## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

It appears that most successful theater projects were in the May, June and July months. Those months also held the most volume.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

It appears that the most success projects were the cheaper ones. The $20,000 or less projects has a success rate of 50% or more

- What are some limitations of this dataset? 

This data is very quantitive. There is not enough qualitive data that would help investors or project managers make better decisions.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? 

There may be a way to get more qualitive information by narrowing down the genre that people suppoert the most. I would also like to see if the projects that had a goal of less than $20,000 had a higher pleged amount.
